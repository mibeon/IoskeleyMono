# IoskeleyMono

![Ioskeley Mono Cover](assets/SocialPreview.png)

The goal of this project is to configure the [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka) typeface to mimic the look and feel of **Berkeley Mono** as closely as possible.

It uses Iosevka's extensive build options to select character variants that replicate the distinct aesthetic of Berkeley Mono, creating a free, open-source alternative for fans of that particular style.

The name is a simple mashup: **Iosevka** + **Berkeley** = **Ioskeley**.

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically build the font files whenever the configuration is updated.

### Configuration Choices

This configuration uses specific character variants and custom metrics to closely match the look and feel of Berkeley Mono.

- **Custom Metrics:** The font's vertical proportions, letter spacing (`sb`), and parenthesis size have been manually adjusted. This is the key to capturing Berkeley's characteristically compact and geometric feel.
- **Distinctive Characters:** Key glyphs were chosen to match, including a **single-storey `g`**, **flat-arc parentheses `()`**, and a **two-circle `8`**.
- **Clarity and Readability:** For the best coding experience, the font uses a **dotted zero**, **open-contour `6` and `9`**, and sharp, **square punctuation**.
- **High Underscore:** The underscore character is raised to ensure it is clearly visible and never blends with the line below.

For a complete list of all choices made to match Berkeley Mono, see the [`private-build-plans.toml`](./private-build-plans.toml) file.
